ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mortenhauan

I'm a technology geek and serial founder from the south of Norway. I try to learn new stuff and see possibilities in new technologies. 

I'm a systems engineer with knowledge of many disciplines, hardware, electronics, hydraulics, etc. And also an average coder and have, for many years, worked with Basic, Visual Basic, C#, PHP, Javascript, and Python. Currently, I'm looking into and trying to learn more about Rust.

I currently work at Intoto, a water data company I co-founded in 2018. I work with embedded systems, engineering, and AI.

I like to bicycle, walk in the mountains, and fly FPV drones in my free time.

Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/morten-hauan/). I'm always interested in talking with experts in their field.
